# Hyperdimensional CD using untrained models

## Change detection in hyperspectral images and any other hyperdimensional images

The proposed method uses an untrained lightweight deep model, initialized with some weight initialization strategy for feature extraction from bi-temporal hyperdimensional images.



**To run the code** please download the datasets and put them in datasets folder.<br/>
Then cd to deepImagePriorNonlinear directory and run the code for Santa Barbara dataset by using following command:  <br/>
python deepImagePriorSantaBarbara.py --manualSeed 40 <br/>
The manual seed can be varied.
